The entry point for your SQLite implementation is in `app/main.js`.

Study and uncomment the relevant code: 

```javascript
// Uncomment this to pass the first stage
console.log(`number of tables: ${sqliteSchemaRows.length}`);
```

Push your changes to pass the first stage:

```
git add .
git commit -m "pass 1st stage" # any msg
git push origin master
```
